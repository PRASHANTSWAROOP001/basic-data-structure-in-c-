# basic-data-structure-in-c++
hello i created this repository to help beginners understand the basic data structes.
i dont find any reliable source to learn DS.
I bet if you try to learn data structres online in c++ most of the code would be written in c not in c++.
which pissed me off. so to help others and myself i created this github repository.
Please feel free to use thsese code and play around it.
